# EU Compliance & IP Operations Portfolio

This repository documents my structured learning and practical portfolio development in:

- EU regulatory and product compliance (REACH, CLP)
- Compliance operations and documentation
- QMS-style issue and CAPA management (Effivity-style)
- Compliance analytics and reporting
- IP-aware operations (non-attorney)

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate practical, operational understanding of compliance systems used in EU organizations, with a focus on documentation, traceability, and audit readiness.
