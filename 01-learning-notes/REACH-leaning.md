# REACH Regulation – Overview & Obligations

## 1. What is REACH?

**REACH** stands for:

> **Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals**

REACH is a European Union chemicals regulation that governs the **manufacture, import, use, and placing on the market of chemical substances** in the EU.

It shifts the **burden of proof** from authorities to **companies**, requiring them to demonstrate that their chemicals are safe for human health and the environment.

---

## 2. Objectives of REACH

The main objectives of REACH are:

- Protect **human health** and the **environment**
- Promote **safe use of chemicals**
- Improve **transparency** of chemical information
- Encourage **substitution of hazardous substances**
- Enhance **innovation and competitiveness** of EU industry
- Reduce **animal testing** through data sharing

---

## 3. Scope of REACH

REACH applies to:

- Substances on their own  
- Substances in mixtures  
- Substances intentionally released from articles  

Threshold:
- Applies when quantities are **≥ 1 tonne per year per legal entity**

---

## 4. Key Principles of REACH

- **No data, no market**
- Industry is responsible for chemical safety
- Risk-based regulation
- Shared data and cost-sharing
- Lifecycle approach (manufacture → use → disposal)

---

## 5. Economic Operators under REACH

### 5.1 Manufacturer
A **Manufacturer** is any natural or legal person established in the EU who **manufactures a substance** within the EU.

**Core obligations:**
- Register substances ≥ 1 tonne/year
- Generate safety data
- Prepare Chemical Safety Report (CSR) if ≥ 10 tonnes/year
- Classify and label substances
- Communicate safety information via SDS

---

### 5.2 Importer
An **Importer** is any person established in the EU who **imports a substance or mixture** from outside the EU.

**Core obligations:**
- Same obligations as manufacturers
- Ensure non-EU suppliers comply indirectly
- Register substances unless covered by an Only Representative (OR)

---

### 5.3 Downstream User (DU)
A **Downstream User** uses a substance in industrial or professional activities but does not manufacture or import it.

**Core obligations:**
- Follow conditions described in Safety Data Sheets (SDS)
- Check whether their use is covered in exposure scenarios
- Implement risk management measures
- Prepare DU Chemical Safety Report if use is not covered
- Inform suppliers of new uses

---

### 5.4 Distributor
A **Distributor** stores or places substances or mixtures on the market without modifying them.

**Core obligations:**
- Pass on SDS and exposure scenarios
- Ensure correct labelling and packaging
- No registration obligation

---

### 5.5 Only Representative (OR)
An **Only Representative** is an EU-based entity appointed by a **non-EU manufacturer**.

**Purpose:**
- Takes over REACH obligations of EU importers
- Allows non-EU manufacturers to retain control of registrations

**Core obligations:**
- Register substances
- Maintain tonnage tracking
- Communicate with downstream users
- Keep records of imported quantities

---

## 6. REACH Processes Explained

### 6.1 Registration
- Submission of technical dossier to ECHA
- Includes substance identity, hazards, uses, exposure
- Mandatory before placing substance on EU market

---

### 6.2 Evaluation
- Authorities evaluate dossiers and substances
- Ensures data quality and addresses concerns
- May lead to requests for further testing

---

### 6.3 Authorisation
- Applies to **Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC)**
- Requires permission for continued use
- Encourages substitution with safer alternatives

---

### 6.4 Restriction
- Limits or bans manufacture, use, or placing on market
- Applies EU-wide
- Can target specific uses or concentrations

---

## 7. Information & Communication Duties

- Safety Data Sheets (SDS)
- Extended SDS (eSDS) with exposure scenarios
- Classification & Labelling (CLP alignment)
- Supply chain communication (upstream & downstream)

---

## 8. Consequences of Non-Compliance

- Market bans
- Heavy fines
- Criminal liability in some Member States
- Supply chain disruption
- Loss of market access

---

## 9. Why REACH is Critical for Businesses

- Legal access to EU market
- Supply chain credibility
- Risk reduction
- Corporate responsibility
- Long-term sustainability

---

## 10. Summary

REACH is not just a regulation—it is a **chemical safety management system**.

Understanding:
- **Who you are (role)**
- **What you place on the market**
- **How substances are used**
- **What data is required**

is essential for compliance and professional practice in EU chemical regulation.
