# Microplastics (SPM) Reporting : Compliance Checklist  
**REACH Annex XVII, Entry 78**


---

## Applicability Check

- [ ] Do you manufacture, use, or supply polymers meeting the **Synthetic Polymer Microparticle (SPM)** definition?
- [ ] Are the polymers **solid, persistent**, and capable of accumulating as microplastics?
- [ ] Is your use **derogated (exempted)** from the placing-on-the-market ban?

**If yes, annual emission reporting applies.**


---

## Reporting Timeline

- [ ] **2026 reporting start**  
  Manufacturers and industrial downstream users of SPMs in the form of pellets, flakes, and powders used as feedstock in plastic manufacturing.

- [ ] **2027 reporting start**  
  All other manufacturers, industrial downstream users, and suppliers of products containing SPMs.

- [ ] **Submission deadline:** 31 May each year  
- [ ] Covers emissions from the **previous calendar year**

---

## Data Preparation (Before IUCLID)

- [ ] Identify SPM use(s) and applicable derogation(s)
- [ ] Estimate annual emissions to the environment
- [ ] Compile generic polymer identity information
- [ ] Identify manufacturing and/or use sites (if applicable)

---

## IUCLID 6 Setup

- [ ] Use **IUCLID 6** (Standalone or ECHA Cloud)

### Section 1 & 1.1
- **IUPAC Name:** Synthetic polymer microparticles  
- **Inventory No.:** 750-000-6

### Section 2
- [ ] Use description and applicable derogation
- [ ] Site details (manufacturers and industrial downstream users)
- [ ] Generic polymer identity
- [ ] Estimated annual emissions

**Note:** Legal entity and site data are confidential and accessible only to the European Chemicals Agency and Member State authorities.
