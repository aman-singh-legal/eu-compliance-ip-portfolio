# SVHC Monitoring Register

## 1. Purpose of This Register

This **SVHC Monitoring Register** is maintained to:
- Monitor substances listed or proposed as **Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC)**
- Track regulatory status changes under the **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}**
- Support proactive compliance, substitution planning, and supply-chain communication
- Demonstrate due diligence to authorities, customers, and auditors

This register is a **living compliance document** and must be reviewed regularly.

---

## 2. What Is an SVHC?

A **Substance of Very High Concern (SVHC)** is a substance that may have serious effects on:
- human health, or
- the environment

SVHCs are identified under Article 57 of REACH and may be included in the **Candidate List** published by **:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} (ECHA)**.

---

## 3. Why SVHC Monitoring Is Critical

Monitoring SVHCs is essential because:
- Candidate List updates occur **twice per year**
- Obligations apply **immediately** after listing
- SVHCs may later move to **Authorisation (Annex XIV)**
- Supply chain communication duties are triggered even without authorisation
- Early monitoring enables **risk management and substitution**

Failure to monitor SVHCs can result in:
- non-compliance
- supply chain disruption
- customer loss
- enforcement actions

---

## 4. Scope of This Register

This register covers:
- Substances on their own
- Substances in mixtures
- Substances in articles (where applicable)
- All suppliers, imported materials, and internally used substances
